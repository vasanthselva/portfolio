    <h2>Sign Language Recognition using Python</h2>
  <p>Domain - Deep Learning aims at translating the sign language into text, so facilitate the communication between hearing impaired people and normal people.<p>
    The major communication tool for people with disabilities is sign language, which is a visual language that uses hand gestures, changes in hand shape, and track information to express meaning. Deafness in both hearing and speaking Recognize sign language can help to solve the issue of the increasing number of people who require assistance The number of people who use sign language is growing, as is its popularity.is inadequate, and provide a more comfortable approach to study, work, and socialize. A hand to create a locating network based on the Faster R-CNN, recognize the hand section in the video or the sign language video picture, as well as the recognition result, is passed along to. A 3D CNN feature extraction with additional processing based on a network and a sign-language recognition framework Coding and decoding in Long and Short-Term Memory The network is built for the sign language images of sequence The framework has the potential to enhance Learning the context of sign language improves recognition accuracy. Another approach to sign language recognition is to use deep learning techniques. Deep learning models can learn to recognize signs directly from the video or image data, without the need to extract features manually. This can lead to more accurate sign language recognition, but it also requires more data to train the models.
